This my solution for the level 1 of the challenge.

Feel free to suggest corrections and optimizations to the code with a pull request or to fork the code.

# Compiling

Windows:

- You need to be in the main folder of the project then run the following commands on the command prompt (cmd):

	- First run the command to compile the program "gcc WordPuzzleChallenge.c -o WordPuzzleChallenge".

		- You need to have gcc configured in your PATH in windows for the command to work.

		- If you have "make" in your PATH, you simply can run the command "make WordPuzzleChallenge". To remove the compiled executable you can execute the command: "make clean"

	- After compiling the program, to execute it, do the command: "WordPuzzleChallenge". 

Linux/Unix based OS:

- You need to be in the main folder of the project then run the following commands on the terminal:

	- First run the command to compile the program: "make WordPuzzleChallenge". 
	
		- To remove the compiled executable you can execute the command: "make clean".

	- After compiling the program, to execute it, do the command: "./WordPuzzleChallenge".
